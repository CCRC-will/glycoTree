rule_id	class	description	logic
1	biosynthesis	positive glycosyltransferase acceptor substrate specificity	transfer of residue [focus] by [agent] in [taxonomy] requires residue [factor_1]
2	biosynthesis	negative glycosyltransferase acceptor substrate specificity	transfer of residue [focus] by [agent] in [taxonomy] blocked by residue [factor_1]
3	biosynthesis	TBD when this rule is more explicitly specified	residue [focus] demands [factor_1]
4	structure	abiotic glycosyl linkage	residue [focus] has an abiotic glycosyl linkage
5	structure	abiotic configuration	residue [focus] has an abiotic configuration
6	structure	abiotic context (location)	residue [focus] has an abiotic structural context
7	taxonomy	taxonomic limitation	residue [focus] is limited to [factor_1] in [taxonomy]
