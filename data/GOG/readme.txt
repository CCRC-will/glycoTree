1180 "GOG" files have been taken from the GlycO ontology.
These have been vetted as mammalian glycans by M. Tiemeyer using Qrator.
Most are mapped to GlyTouCan accessions, but about 10 are not,
    (see ./N-Glycan.idmap.csv)
It seems that all of the rest are present in GlyTouCan.
Many (472) are missing from GlyGen.
    (see ./notFound.lst)
Only 703 of the GOG files are present in GlyGen.
    (see ./files.lst)
